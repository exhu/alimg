Image processing algorithms. Initially implemented dithering for RGBA4444.
Distributed under BSD-like license, so use freely.

This is a complete remake of my first dithering utility to process images 
for OpenGL ES enabled devices to reduce colors from 32-bit to 16-bit.

img2buf -- converts png to a simple binary format (width, height, bitmap data)
for easy implementation of further processing in different programming 
languages (experimenting etc.).

The goal is to provide fast and easy to read and maintain implementations in
different programming languages, i.e. optimized but not too much.

bufdither_java -- dithering implementation in java.
